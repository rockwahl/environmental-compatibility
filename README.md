Environmental Compatibility Checker for Thermal Cameras
Overview
The Environmental Compatibility Checker tool is designed for users who want to assess if a specific thermal camera is suitable for use under certain environmental conditions. Users can input conditions like temperature, humidity, and seismic resistance to determine the camera's compatibility.

Features
Temperature Check: Users can input the ambient temperature in Celsius to verify if the thermal camera can operate within that range.
Humidity Check: Users can define the humidity level to determine if the camera can function effectively under such conditions.
Seismic Resistance Check: If the camera is to be used in an area with seismic activity, users can input the expected seismic resistance to see if the camera can withstand it.
Implementation
The tool is implemented using HTML for the frontend form, CSS for styling, and JavaScript for functionality. Users input their conditions, click on a button, and receive instant feedback about the camera's compatibility.

Integration
To integrate the tool into a website:

Add the provided HTML code to the desired page or post.
Incorporate the given CSS into the site's styling to ensure the tool looks consistent with the rest of the site.
Implement the JavaScript functionality, making sure it's loaded after the HTML.
Usage
Input the environmental conditions in the respective fields.
Click the "Check Suitability" button.
View the result to determine if the camera is suitable for the provided conditions.
